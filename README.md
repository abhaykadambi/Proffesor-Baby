# Proffesor-Baby
A chrome extension to keep you on task, it's also Dababy.

This is a chrome extension that, once turned on, will change all new tabs to dababy's new song RED LIGHT GREEN LIGHT. The beat on this song is just a flute and sounds very old timey, something unbecomming to Dababy but just right for Sir Baby. The screen will show a photoshopped image of dababy on horseback while blasting his song at maximum volume. Great for learning. Just like Dababy always said, "yea yea".
